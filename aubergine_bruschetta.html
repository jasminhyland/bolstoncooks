      <p>The great thing about this recipe is that when I am fancying something like pizza this satisfies the craving and some! I like
      to pair it with some of my home made loaf (the recipe will be up shortly). The thought process behind this was one of loving aubergine and adding what I would like on a pizza and top it with cheese, then I was still hungry so added the bread. It works I promise.</p>

       <p>The key elements is to keep the ingredients fresh, this recipe includes one of my favourite combinations: fresh basil, garlic, red onion, olives and tomatoes.
       then pair that with the aubergine and ... ratouille style fireworks.</p>

      <p>Not only is this recipe healthy but it's super tasty. Also can be used as a bit of a use up dinner, when you have a few veggies that are a bit less then fresh
      you can add them to the filling. I have also recently found something to put the filling to the next level. This was <a href= "https://www.enconasauces.co.uk/products/moroccan-harissa-marinade">Encona's harrissa marinade.</a></p>
