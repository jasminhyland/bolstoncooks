      <p> This lasagna recipe is award winning (ok the award might just be pasta champion from my friends "pasta off" but still).
        There is something so homely about a lasagna, like a warm hug. I make mine dairy free because i'm very much intolerant. It can
        also easily be made vegan, by using a meat subsitute, my personal favourite being Holland & Barratts <a href="https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/holland-barrett-savoury-soya-protein-mince-60082491?skuid=082491">Protein Mince.</a>
        Also for the bechemel there are so many different cheeses to choose from now the <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/305836512">Applewood Smoky Cheese</a> is *chefs kiss*, but its up to you! Substitute
        as you wish.</p>

       <p> I spent weeks perfecting my lasagna and I am quite pleased with it, but as always let me know what you think! I personally find it best
        to start it in the morning, i then leave to simmer throughout the day, before assembling and cooking before dinner time. I actually
        find doing it this way makes it a whole lot less daunting. You could wake up a bit early chuck it in the slow cooker then by time you get home
        its ready to assemble.</p>

      <p>  As with all my recipes the quantities of ingredients are a guideline - the best way is to taste test as you go along. Key thing to remember
        is you can always add but its a lot harder to take away! Trust me, I once had a chilli that tasted like hot chocolate because of how much
        I decided to chuck in.</p>

      <h3> Method</h3>
      <ol>
      <li> If using beef mince: put this in a hot pan to sear. Once this is seared remove the mince
      whilst keeping the fat in the pan. For a vegan version heat up some dairy free butter in your pan instead</li>
      <li> Add in some finely diced garlic, onion, celery and carrot. That fancy italian style way. Give it a nice stir and
      allow to sizzle for a while, until fraguent and onions are clear and turn the heat to low.</li>
      <li> I like to add seasoning at this point as well as later on so: chuck in Salt and Pepper along with a tablespoon each of: Oregano, Basil and
      Tarragon. Mix and cook for a further 5 minutes. </li>
      <li> Add in a tablespoon of tomato puree and your chopped tomatoes. You can also either re-add your mince or add in your vegan mince at this point.</li>
      <li> Stir and add in a tablespoon of honey,two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, a small glass of red wine and 250ml of stock. </li>
      <li> You're now going to let this simmer for as long as you can really, on a low heat, making sure to give a stir every now and then, as well as add extra seasoning.</li>
      <li> Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees</li>
      <li> When you're nearly ready to assemble start your bechemel. Melt two tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, then add in your flour, stir this into a paste. Then slowly
      add your milk, I like to use oat milk. Once you get your bechemel just slighlty runnier than you would like it (making sure is smooth by stirring a LOT) Then add in 2/3 of your grated
    cheese and nutmeg.</li>
      <li> Once the cheese is nicely melted and you're happy with the taste of your bechemel (I sometimes like to add a dash of paprika if you have it.) You can now
      assemble. The key part here is that you don't want undercooked pasta sheets so try to use fresh ones that are covered in plenty of liquid. If you are using dry
    pre boil them first.</li>
      <li> To layer in our tin we are going to start with a thin layer of bolognese then your order will be :1)pasta 2)bolognese 3) cheese sauce 4) basil leaves 5) pasta sheets and repeat.</li>
      <li> Once you are reaching the top of the tin and are done, add the rest of your grated cheese and stick in the oven for 20-30 mins, or until golden. Let rest for 10 minutes, then enjoy!!</li>
      </ol>
