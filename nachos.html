      <p> My partner and I first made this nacho recipe when I was told my uni house would be watching the superbowl. I don't like to miss out on the fun
      but definitley needed something else to entertain me for the night. So we decided to go all out with some tasty food (plus many many drinks). The thing
    that I LOVE about these is the cheese sauce combined with the jaleponos. No matter how full we are, we will still be fighting over the last bites. </p>

       <p> A great way to make this into a super cheap and easy meal is to use left over chilli. I love pretending like i'm going to be healthy by making a load
         of chilli and having that for a couple days, knowing i'm looking forward to the real star of the show to cover with a load of cheesy goodness. This can easily be
       made vegan, I use an intolerant person's cheese along with a three bean chilli instead of meat. The tortilla chips to use are up to you, sometimes I go for the cheapest
       option and sometimes I treat myself to the Chilli Heatwave Doritos. I have also included the recipe for a lil guacamole to have on the side.</p>

      <p>  As with all my recipes the quantities of ingredients are a guideline - the best way is to taste test as you go along. Key thing to remember
        is you can always add but its a lot harder to take away! Trust me, I once had a chilli that tasted like hot chocolate because of how much
        I decided to chuck in.</p>

      <h3> Method</h3>
      <ol>
      <li> If using beef mince: put this in a hot pan to sear. Once this is seared remove the mince
      whilst keeping the fat in the pan. For a vegan version heat up some dairy free butter in your pan instead</li>
      <li> Add in some finely diced garlic and onion. Give it a nice stir and allow to sizzle for a while, until fraguent and onions are clear and turn the heat to low.</li>
      <li> I like to add seasoning at this point as well as later on so: chuck in Salt and Pepper along with a tablespoon each of: Paprika, Cayenne Pepper, Chilli Powder and
      Corriander. Mix and cook for a further 5 minutes. </li>
      <li> Add in a tablespoon of tomato puree and your chopped tomatoes. You can also either re-add your mince or add in your vegan mince at this point.</li>
      <li> Stir and add in a tablespoon of honey,two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, your chocolate, a small glass of red wine and 250ml of stock. </li>
      <li> You're now going to let this simmer for as long as you can really, on a low heat, making sure to give a stir every now and then, as well as add extra seasoning.</li>
      <li> Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees</li>
      <li> When you're nearly ready to assemble start your bechemel. Melt two tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, then add in your flour, stir this into a paste. Then slowly
      add your milk, I like to use oat milk. Once you get your bechemel just slighlty runnier than you would like it (making sure is smooth by stirring a LOT) Then add in 2/3 of your grated
    cheese and nutmeg.</li>
      <li> For assembly, in a large lasagna dish put in your bag of tortilla chips, then top with you chilli, the bechemel and sprinkle over some jalepo√±os and corriander. Put in the oven for 10-15 minutes.</li>
      <li> Whilst this is cooking you can make some guacamole, mash up an avacado and add a finely chopped red onion and corrainder. A good squirting of lemon juice, salt, pepper, smoked Paprika and some chilli flakes.</li>
      <li> Take out your nachos and enjoy!</li>
