      <p>I came up with this recipe on pancake day. I'm one of those people that loves any excuse to make a big deal of all holidays, any excuse for a good time and good food right?
      So I decided I was going to make a different pancake for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is one I decided to have for breakfast (but feel free to have it any time of day), a dairy free spinach and ricotta pancake.It's something that
      would be lovely to have with your friends for brunch on a saturday morning.
    I added in the egg to make it more breakfasty but to make it vegan you can just keep that part out!</p>

       <p>Before I stopped eating dairy one of my favourite things was those spinach and ricotta tortellinis, thats why I was so excited to disover a way to make the ricotta vegan.
       I was scared it would be a lot of effort to end up in a result that would taste appaling. Thankfully though this one worked so well. Then because this pancake has spinach we can
     tell ourselves its healthy! In all seriosuness, it is a high protein and healthier version of ricotta and because of that this actually ends up being a healhty recipe that will
   certainly keep you nice and full.</p>

      <li>300ml Soya Milk</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons Olive Oil.</li>
      <li>1 bag of spinach</li>
      <li>400g tofu</li>
      <li>Tablespoon of garlic</li>
      <li>Tablespoon miso paste</li>
      <li>Tablespoon of butter</li>

      <h3> Method</h3>
      <ol>
      <li>First make the pancake batter. In a jug whisk together 2 eggs, soya milk and olive oil. Then slowly add the flour whilst whisking, this will help keep the batter smooth and
      without lumps. Once its all mixed in also add some salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Prep the ricotta, to do this break up the tofu and add it to a blender. Then add in the miso, salt, pepper,garlic, basil, tarragon and tablespoon olive oil. Then blend until creamy and season to taste.</li>
      <li>blend up the spinach and add in as much ricotta as you would like for your pancake filling.</li>
      <li>Put the butter in the pan and melt down. Whisk the batter again, then add it to the pan until there is a nice thin layer.</li>
      <li>Once it starts to bubble and lift up flip the pancake. Now, in the centre add your spinach ricotta filling.</li>
      <li>Lower the hear and fold up the sides so they create a parcel. In this parcel you can crack an egg. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper onto the egg and then put a lid or large plate over the pan.</li>
      <li>The steam will cook the egg. Once the egg whites look cooked you can take it out of the pan and plate up. Little tip - this goes really well with some encona hot sauce!</li>
      </ol>
