      <p>
        This is our go to meal for a date night, perfect when you feel like treating yourselves but also fancy staying in. I personally prefer
      making a steak at home because its a lot easier than you think and you can cook it to exactly how you want it! No having to awkwardly send it back
    because everyone seems to have a different definition of medium rare. Also once we discovered chimmichurri there was no going back, it adds spice and freshness
  which really takes your steak to a whole new level. You also don't even have to make it into a sandwich, sometimes we have it with homemade chips and veg. Although, in my opinion the way the juices get
soaked up into the bread is just unbeatable.</p>

       <p>Ciabatta is my go to bread of choice as its not only super tasty but the flat surface does make it easier for eating. You can also add as many toppings as you like, a layer of caramlised onions would be very tasty, a nice handful of rocket,
       maybe even swap out the chimmichurri for a peppercorn sauce if you fancy it. In terms of which steak to use its, again, up to you! You can go to the butchers or your favourite supermarket, a good tip though is to try and choose a steak with the
     most marbling. </p>

      <p>  As with all my recipes the quantities of ingredients are a guideline - the best way is to taste test as you go along. Key thing to remember
        is you can always add but its a lot harder to take away! Trust me, I once had a chilli that tasted like hot chocolate because of how much
        I decided to chuck in.</p>

      <h3> Ingredients</h3>
      <li>Steak</li>
      <li>Fresh Rosemary</li>
      <li>Head of Garlic</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>Ciabatta</li>
      <li>handful fresh parsley</li>
      <li>Teaspoon of Oregano</li>
      <li>2 Red Chillis</li>
      <li>Lemon Juice</li>
      <li>Handful of corriander</li>
      <li>Teaspoon red wine vinegar</li>

      <h3> Method</h3>
      <ol>
      <li>Caramalise some onions by chopping them adding to a pan with melted butter in, add some salt and sugar and leave on low heat, until caramalised.</li>
      <li>Make the Chimmichurri, this is best with a crunch so don't blend the ingredients. Instead roughly chop the parsley, corriander, one glove of garlic and chillis and add to a bowel</li>
      <li>Add the olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt and pepper. Then season to taste.</li>
      <li>Make sure to let the steak come to room temperature, pat dry and season with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Take a couple garlic cloves out of the shells and get some twigs of rosemary. Put some oil in a pan and heat up nice and hot. A good way to test if the oil is hot is to dip hand in water and spray in pan,
      if the oil bubbles its ready. But be careful, hot oil really hurts.</li>
      <li>Place the steak in the pan and make sure to put it in away from you. Sear on each side for a couple minutes, it will depend on the thickness of your steak and how well done you like it.</li>
      <li>Once each side is seared, turn down the heat place the garlic and rosemary on top of the steak and add two table spoons of butter into the pan. Then use a spoon to base the steak, this is just spooning the melted butter over the steak.</li>
      <li>Once the steak is done to your liking take it out and leave it to rest for at least 5 minutes, as a guide for medium-rare cook for a total of 3-4 minutes each side.</li>
      <li>Slice your bread and toast it in the pan to soak up all those flavours.</li>
      <li>Now just assemble! Layer of onions, slice the steak and add it, then drizzle on the chimmichurri.</li>
      </ol>
